            <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
            <p>
              Motivated by a shared love for the rhythmic crash of waves and the
              feeling of sand between our toes, our family decided to build our
              dream into reality. we yearned to create a space where others
              could escape the everyday hustle and reconnect with nature's raw
              beauty right on the coast. Inspired by the scenic hiking paths
              that wound through the nearby cliffs and down to the shore, and
              wanting a unique, comfortable lodging experience, we established
              "Pacific Trails Resort" offering cozy yurts just steps from the
              ocean. A perfect blend of seaside tranquility and coastal
              adventure.
